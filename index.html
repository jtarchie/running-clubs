          <p>We all should have known better than to think we were done with snow and muddy trails this season. Most likely we’ll have to run pavement this week, so we’ll meet at Bear Creek Lake Park. Meet at the dirt lot across Rooney Road from the Conoco Gas Station at C470 and Morrison Road for a 6:15pm start. The run will go for about 75min.</p>

<p>After the run we’ll grab dinner somewhere nearby. I’m partial to something in Denver West, but Morrison restaurants are also an option. Hope to see you there!</p>

          <p>STAR WARS THEMED! PEW! PEW!</p>

<p>HPRS Trail Work in Sedalia, CO - In Cooperation with Denver Trail Runners</p>

<p>YOU MUST REGISTER TO JOIN US! We have space for 15-20 people only.</p>

<p>Background: The Human Potential Running Series (HPRS) owned and operated by Human Potential LLC, has teamed up with COMBA and Backcountry Horsemen to revitalize the trails of the Indian Creek system. We have done this to continue on our mission of not only building a better ultra community for our runners, but to improve the relationships between ultra running and the land managers we work with.</p>

<p>WHY: (Besides it being the right thing to do) Many races have started to require their participants complete at least 8-hours of volunteer trail work prior to running in their event. The Human Potential Running Series requires 8-hours of volunteer trail work for those to be able to participate in the Silverheels 100-Mile Endurance Run (Though, runners can opt out of this requirement by submitting a $150 donation to 2-Mile High Inc.</p>

<p>Due to the growing number of races requiring volunteer trail work, as well as our own requirements, HPRS is also proud to adopt these trails to better serve the Colorado ultrarunning community in fulfilling these requirements. Every year, HPRS will be releasing a trail work schedule to allow folks to plan which workdays they’d like to attend between the months of June and October.</p>

<p>Trail maintenance is hard physical labor.  Volunteers will be hiking with five to seven pound tools in hand.</p>

<p>REQUIREMENTS:
Be in good physical condition
Be able to use a variety of tools, including shovels, picks and rakes
Volunteers under 16 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian
Be prepared for numerous and changing environmental conditions</p>

<p>WHAT TO BRING &amp; WEAR:
Closed-toe, sturdy shoes are required. No open-toed shoes or sandals of any kind will be allowed.
Work gloves
Plenty of water (2 quarts minimum)
Raingear
Sunscreen and insect repellent
Toilet paper (recommended)
A day pack</p>

<p>Your volunteering also qualifies you for a HPRS Volunteer Comp which you can “cash in” for a comp entry to any race. To learn more about our other volunteer opporunities and how to “cash in” your comp, visit our website HERE.</p>
